## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
mvn compile quarkus:dev
```

## Packaging and running the application

```shell script
mvn package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _Ã¼ber-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
mvn package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
mvn package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```
